# The-Recount-Project
This is my MVP of the Family Tree within 3 Hours



# Assignment:

Family Tree Browser (Frontend-Focused)
Create a website for a family tree service. The site should have these views:



//A home view for the "current user" that lists the members of their family tree.//


//A person view that displays information about a person and links to their direct family (parents, siblings, children)//


//A view that lets the "current user" edit their information (doesn't have to actually be saved or make a real API call)//
